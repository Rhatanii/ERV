## 💡 Training & Evaluation

### 🛠️ Training Code

The model training consists of two main stages.

1.  **SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) for Cold Start**
    * **Description:** The initial supervised learning phase to establish baseline model performance with formatted output.
    ```bash
    scripts/finetune_omni_add_reasoning.sh
    ```

2.  **GRPO Training with ERV**
    * **Description:** The RL phase using GRPO to optimize for emotion-coherent reasoning.
    ```bash
    src/r1-v/run_grpo_ERV.sh
    ```

### 📊 Evaluation Code

Scripts for evaluating reasoning coherence and core performance metrics.

1.  **Emotion Recognition Performance**
    * **Objective:** Measure the accuracy of the Emotion Recognition task.
    ```bash
    python eval_score.py
    ```

2.  **Novel Metrics about Reasoning**
    * **Objective:** Measure the consistency and quality of the generated emotional rationales.

    * **A. Emotional Judgment via GPT API**
        * **Description:** Uses the GPT API to assess the emotional coherence of the generated reasoning.
        * **Execution:**
            ```bash
            bash tools/response_gpt_check.sh
            ```
        * **Note:** Requires GPT API key setup in the `tools/utils.py` directory.

    * **B. EEA / FCR / EPC Metric Check**
        * **Description:** Calculates key reasoning metrics: **E**xplanation **E**motion **A**ccuracy (EEA), **F**aithgul **C**onsistency **R**ate (FCR), and **E**xplanation-**P**rediction **C**onsistency (EPC).
        ```bash
        cd tools/compare
        python compare_reason_recognition.py
        ```
